# Forms.VCL
Common UI VCL Forms used in mine projects (ex. About_frm)

1. Put forms -> ./SRC/OBSOLETE/PROG/FORM_TEMPLATES/

2. Put applications (.VCL) into ./SRC/OBSOLETE/PROG/Application.VCL

3. Classes.VCL -> ./SRC/X86_WIN32_CLASSES/

4. Put libraries into -> ./SRC/X86_LIBRARIES/

5. Put dclusr50.VCL into ./SRC/OBSOLETE/PACKAGES

Before You have to open compile/install controls, then open and compile application.
